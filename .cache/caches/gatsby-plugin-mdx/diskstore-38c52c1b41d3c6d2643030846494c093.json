There are about a hundred standard functions universally supported in popular frameworks today e.g. convolution, matrix multiplication, various reductions, and normalizations. Additionally, some frameworks provide an even more extensive set of variants of these functions for ease of use. `}</p>\n    <p>{`In designing the WebNN operations, a proposal to decompose high-level functions to the more rudimentary mathematical operations was considered, with the key benefit of having a reduced number of operations defined. However, such an approach would make the networks more verbose and harder to construct. It’ll also risk losing the opportunity to leverage known optimizations for highly reusable functions in the operating systems and in the hardware platforms underneath it. For instance, most operating systems and modern hardware today support widely-used variants of convolutions and recurrent networks out of the box. By decomposing well-known functions into networks of rudimentary mathematical operations, their identities may be lost in the process with opportunities for significant performance gains left behind.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To balance the needs of providing for future extensibility while ensuring maximum reuse and performance optimization opportunity, we chose to include both the standard functions and all the smaller operations making up the functions in the spec. For each high-level function defined, we make sure that all of its decomposed operations are also defined. This way, a newly-conceived function may be represented as a network of our decomposed operations, while a standard function can also be fully supported by the underlying platforms. An elaborate example of this principle is in the way we define the specification of the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webnn/#api-modelbuilder-grucell\"\n      }}>{`gruCell`}</a>{` operation as described in its notes.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Considered alternatives`}</h2>\n    <h3>{`Stay the course and build machine learning solutions on WebGL/WebGPU`}</h3>\n    <p>{`WebGL and WebGPU are Web API abstraction to the underlying graphics API, which could be used to implement neural network operations that run on the GPU. Popular JavaScript machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow.js already uses WebGL and are working on a WebGPU backend. An alternative to the WebNN proposal is to continue with this architecture and rely on JavaScript frameworks implemented with these graphics abstraction to address the current and future needs of ML scenarios on the web.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We believe this alternative is insufficient for two reasons. First, although graphics abstraction layers provide the flexibility of general programmability of the GPU graphics pipelines, they are unable to tap into hardware-specific optimizations and special instructions that are available to the operating system internals. The hardware ecosystem has been investing significantly in innovating in the ML space, and much of that is about improving the performance of intensive compute workloads in machine learning scenarios. Some key technologies that are important to model performance may not be uniformly accessible to applications through generic graphics pipeline states.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Secondly, the hardware diversity with numerous driver generations make conformance testing of neural network operations at the framework level more challenging. Conformance testing, compatibility, and quality assurance of hardware results have been the traditional areas of strength of the operating systems, something that should be leveraged by frameworks and applications alike. Since neural network models could be used in mission-critical scenarios such as in healthcare or industry processes, the trustworthiness of the results produced by the frameworks are of utmost importance to the users.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`References & acknowledgements`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Thanks to all the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.w3.org/community/webmachinelearning/\"\n      }}>{`Machine Learning for the Web Community Group`}</a>{` and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.w3.org/2020/06/machine-learning-workshop/\"\n      }}>{`W3C Workshop on Web and Machine Learning`}</a>{` participants for their comments and feedbacks that have informed the design of this API.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
