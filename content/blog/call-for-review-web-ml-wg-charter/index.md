As part of ensuring that the community is aware of proposed work
at W3C, this draft charter is public during the Advisory
Committee review period.

W3C invites public comments through 03:59 UTC on 2021-03-27
(23:59, Eastern time on 2021-03-26) on the proposed charter.
Please send comments to public-new-work@w3.org, which has a public archive [lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/).

Other than comments sent in formal responses by W3C Advisory
Committee Representatives, W3C cannot guarantee a response to
